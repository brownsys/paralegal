# Paralegal

A tool for enforcing privacy policies on Rust code.

Hello there curious GitHub surfer. I don't know how you got here but welcome.
This is the home of Paralegal, a static, data and control flow based Rust code
policy enforcer.

While you've certainly "come to the right place" our tool is not in a shape yet
where the wider public can easily adopt it. However we are working hard to get
to that point and we would be happy to let you know as soon as we're ready for
you. You can leave a contact email in this [Google
Form](https://forms.gle/QkijL7jSCksjirNP6) and we will send you a message once
Paralegal goes fully public. 

You can also leave us a note in the form on how you want to apply our tool and
if we find your use case particularly compelling, we will give you early access
and personal support.
