//! Unique identifiers for a point in the MIR program execution that span cross
//! function boundaries.
//!
//! The idea of a global location is to capture the call chain up to a specific
//! location.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Consider the following code:
//!
//! ```
//! fn bar() {
//!     let x = 1;
//! }
//!
//! @[dfpp::analyze]
//! fn foo {
//!     bar();
//!     bar();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The MIR location of `let x = 1` would likely be something like `bb0[0]` i.e.
//! the 0th statement in basic block 0. However if we construct a flow graph of
//! `foo` that traverses into the called functions (e.g. `bar`), this location
//! is no longer unique. In fact the location of the call to `bar` in `foo`
//! probably also has the MIR location `bb0[0]`. In addition the same function
//! can occur twice so we need to be able to disambiguate a location based on
//! the call chain of getting to the location.
//!
//! So in this example when we inline the first call of `bar` at `bb0[0]` the
//! global location for `let x = 1` for that call is `bb0[0]@bb0[0]` (This is
//! what the `impl Display for GlobalLocation` shows). When the second call is
//! inlined the second `let x = 1` would be `bb0[0]@bb1[0]`.
//!
//! In addition we also capture for every location the `BodyId` of the body the
//! location occurs in, so we can later find the body and the code at that
//! location.
//!
//! # Construction
//!
//! [`GLI::globalize_location`] is used to construct global locations that are
//! not nested in a call chain (such as the location of `let x = 1` within
//! `bar`). A nested location (such as nesting this one behind the call to `bar`
//! in `foo`) is done using [`GLI::global_location_from_relative`].
//!
//! In the example we would first construct global locations for all locations
//! in `bar` with (pseudocode) `bar_bb0[0] = `[`gli.globalize_location(bb0[0],
//! bar_id)`](GLI::globalize_location) and then make the relative locations to
//! foo with [`gli.global_location_from_relative(bar_bb0[0], bb0[0],
//! foo_id)`](GLI::global_location_from_relative) and
//! [`gli.global_location_from_relative(bar_bb0[0], bb1[0],
//! foo_id)`](GLI::global_location_from_relative) for the first and second
//! inlining respectively.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! It is organized from the outside in i.e. the top-level function call is the
//! outermost location which calls `next` at `location` going one level deeper
//! and so forth. You may access the innermost location using
//! `GlobalLocation::innermost_location_and_body`.
//!
//! The innermost location is what you'd want to look up if you are wanting to
//! see the actual statement or terminator that this location refers to.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Global locations are intended to be used via the [`IsGlobalLocation`] trait.
//!
//! ## Why we need a trait
//!
//! We intern global locations to make the fact that they are linked lists more
//! efficient. However this makes serialization harder. Since we only use
//! serialization for testing I am doing the lazy thing where I just serialize
//! copies of the linked list. But this also means there's two ways to represent
//! global location, one being the one that recurses with interned pointers, the
//! other uses an owned (e.g. copied) `Box`. This trait lets you treat both of
//! them the same for convenience. This is the reason this trait uses `&self`
//! instead of `self`. For interned values using `self` would be fine, but the
//! serializable version is an owned `Box` and as such would be moved with these
//! function calls.
