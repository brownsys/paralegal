title: Documentation for Paralegal
---

This page hosts the compiled rustdocs for
[`Paralegal`](https://github.com/brownsys/dfpp) and its dependencies and also
for the rust compiler version 1.63.0, which is the one that `paralegal_flow` is
linking against. The compiler docs do not interlink with the docs for the
`paralegal_flow` crate and its dependencies, because I haven't yet figured out
how to build them such that they do. As a result the two documentations are
hosted here separately.

- Generated rustdocs (dependent, non-rustc crates are linked).
  - Doc for the [property definition framework](libs/paralegal_policy/index.html)
  - Internal doc for the [flow analyzer](libs/paralegal_flow/index.html)
- [Link to the rustc 1.63.0 documentation](compiler/index.html)
