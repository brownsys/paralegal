title: Documentation for Dataflow++
---

This page hosts the compiled rustdocs for
[`dfpp`](https://github.com/brownsys/dfpp) and its dependencies and also for the
rust compiler version 1.63.0, which is the one that `dfpp` is linking against.
The compiler docs do not interlink with the docs for the `dfpp` crate and its
dependencies, because I haven't yet figured out how to build them such that they
do. As a result the two documentations are hosted here separately.

- [Link to the rustc 1.63.0 documentation](compiler/index.html)
