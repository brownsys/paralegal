//! Defines pretty printers and dot graph output.
//!
//! Often times the pretty printers wrappers around references to graph structs,
//! like [PrintableMatrix]. These wrappers have
//! `Debug` and/or `Display` implementations so that you can flexibly print them
//! to stdout, a file or a log statement. Some take additional information (such
//! as [TyCtxt]) to get contextual information that is used to make the output
//! more useful.
