# You are probably looking at this because you got an error that the toolchain
# that was configured does not exist,
#
# This is by design. To run this tool you need a patched, source compiled
# version of rust. Once you have created it, you should create "rust-dfpp-patch"
# as a symlink to the patched stage2 compiler.
