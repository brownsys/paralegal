//! Unique identifiers for a point in the MIR program execution that span cross
//! function boundaries.
//!
//! The idea of a global location is to capture the call chain up to a specific
//! location.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Consider the following code:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn bar() {
//!     let x = 1;
//! }
//!
//! #[dfpp::analyze]
//! fn foo {
//!     bar();
//!     bar();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The MIR location of `let x = 1` would likely be something like `bb0[0]` i.e.
//! the 0th statement in basic block 0. However if we construct a flow graph of
//! `foo` that traverses into the called functions (e.g. `bar`), this location
//! is no longer unique. In fact the location of the call to `bar` in `foo`
//! probably also has the MIR location `bb0[0]`. In addition the same function
//! can occur twice so we need to be able to disambiguate a location based on
//! the call chain of getting to the location.
//!
//! So in this example when we inline the first call of `bar` at `bb0[0]` the
//! global location for `let x = 1` for that call is `bb0[0]@bb0[0]` (This is
//! what the `impl Display for GlobalLocation` shows). When the second call is
//! inlined the second `let x = 1` would be `bb0[0]@bb1[0]`.
//!
//! In addition we also capture for every location the `BodyId` of the body the
//! location occurs in, so we can later find the body and the code at that
//! location.
//!
//! # Construction
//!
//! [`GlobalLocation::single`] is used to construct global locations that are
//! not nested in a call chain (such as the location of `let x = 1` within
//! `bar`). A nested location (such as nesting this one behind the call to `bar`
//! in `foo`) is done using [`GlobalLocation::relativize`].
//!
//! In the example we would first construct global locations for all locations
//! in `bar` with (pseudocode) `bar_bb0[0] = `[`GlobalLocation::single(bb0[0],
//! bar_id)`](GlobalLocation::single) and then make the relative locations to
//! foo with [`bar_bb0[0].relativize(bb0[0], foo_id)`](GlobalLocation::relativize) and
//! [`bar_bb0[0].relativize(bb1[0], foo_id)`](GlobalLocation::relativize) for the first and second
//! inlining respectively.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! It is organized from the outside-in, i.e., the top-level function call is the
//! outermost location which calls `next` at `location` going one level deeper
//! and so forth. You may access the innermost location using
//! `GlobalLocation::innermost_location_and_body`.
//!
//! The innermost location is what you'd want to look up if you are wanting to
//! see the actual statement or terminator that this location refers to.
