//! The query engine and framework for defining paralegal policies.
//!
//! It provides a state machine for programmatically extracting and parsing a
//! Semantic Program Dependence Graph (SPDG) and provides combinators and
//! queries on this graph for you to compose into policies.
//!
//! Next we show you the most common workflow, then explain the steps and show
//! you how to customize them to your needs.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! SPDGGenCommand::global()
//!     .run("project/dir/to/analyze")?
//!     .with_context(|ctx| my_property(ctx))
//! ```
//!
//! 1. [`SPDGGenCommand`] lets you programmatically invoke the SDPG extractor.
//!    The [`::global()`](SPDGGenCommand::global) method uses `cargo paralegal-flow` for
//!    this purpose, e.g. a global installation of `cargo-paralegal-flow` that was
//!    performed with `cargo install`.
//!
//!    - [`::custom()`](SPDGGenCommand::custom) lets you instead pick a
//!      different binary to run, for instance from a local installation.
//!    - [`.get_command()`](SPDGGenCommand::get_command) lets you customize the
//!      command, for instance by passing additional arguments such as `--debug`
//!      or `--dump`.
//! 2. [`.run(dir)`](SPDGGenCommand::run) invokes the extractor in `dir`,
//!    returning the path (as a [`GraphLocation`]) where the SPDG was written
//!    to.
//!
//!    Re-running this command often is cheap, because rustc skips the execution
//!    if there are no changes.
//!
//!    You may generate the graph manually and skip steps 1 and 2. In this case
//!    you can specify the [`GraphLocation`] with
//!    [`::std()`](GraphLocation::std), which uses the default graph file name
//!    or [`::custom()`](GraphLocation::custom) to use a custom file name.
//! 3. [`.with_context()`](GraphLocation::with_context) reads and parses the
//!    graph file, then invokes the provided closure with a [`Context`]. After
//!    the closure returns it automatically invokes
//!    [`Context::emit_diagnostics`].
//!
//! For information about how to specify policies see the [`Context`] struct.
//!
//! *Note:* This crate defines both the interface to the property checkers (via
//! [`Context`]) and the implementation of the engine (via
//! [`GraphLocation::build_context`]). A future version of this crate should
//! ideally separate those out so property checkers do not need to depend on the
//! checker implementation.
